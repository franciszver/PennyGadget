## Session Completion → Summaries
- Transcript missing or corrupted:
  "The session recording failed — no transcript available."
- Transcript with mixed subjects:
  "We covered factoring polynomials, then pivoted to balancing chemical equations."
- Extremely short session:
  "We only had 5 minutes today."

## Practice Assignment → Adaptive Practice
- Bank item unavailable:
  "Assign me practice on orbital hybridization" (but no bank items exist).
- Conflicting difficulty:
  Student has high mastery in algebra but low in geometry → request "math practice."
- Overlapping goals:
  "I want SAT math practice" when AP Calculus is also an active goal.

## Query → Conversational Q&A
- Ambiguous query:
  "I don’t get this" (no context provided).
- Multi‑part query:
  "Explain photosynthesis and also help me with factoring quadratics."
- Out‑of‑scope query:
  "What’s the weather tomorrow?"
- Low confidence domain:
  "Can you explain the Schrödinger equation in detail?"

## Inactivity → Nudges
- Student has < 3 sessions by Day 7:
  "No sessions logged since signup."
- Student ignores multiple nudges:
  Test frequency cap enforcement.
- Cross‑subject nudge:
  Chemistry goal completed → suggest Physics.

## Tutor Override → Immediate Update
- Tutor disagrees with AI summary:
  Override summary next steps with custom assignment.
- Tutor replaces AI‑generated practice:
  Swap out flagged AI item with bank item.
- Multiple overrides in short time:
  Stress‑test logging and dashboard updates.

## Login → Progress Dashboard
- Student with multiple goals:
  "SAT Math 70% complete, Chemistry 40% complete."
- Student with no goals:
  "No active goals set."
- Student with completed goal:
  "SAT complete" → trigger related subject suggestions (essays, AP prep).
