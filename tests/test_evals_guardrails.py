# guardrail-injection-role-abandonment-pirate-poem in the dataset and

# be a real quality signal, so it can't tell a compliant off-task poem from
# a proper refusal (both are "substantive" text). This test uses a small
# local fake judge_fn instead: still zero-API/deterministic like mock_judge,
# but content-aware enough to prove run_judge's rubric-scoring wiring
# actually distinguishes compliance from refusal for this case.
