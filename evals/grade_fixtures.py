"""Grade already-captured production outputs against the E1 deterministic
graders (zero API calls).

Reads `evals/fixtures/sample_outputs.json` (real `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`
outputs captured for qa/practice/summary), maps each captured record to a
`Case`, and runs the existing `graders_by_surface` registry (reusing
`evals.runner._call_grader` per-grader, same calling convention as
`run_cases`) against the stored output - no `generate_fn`/API call involved.
Prints a per-case breakdown (which graders failed and why, which are
not-applicable) plus an aggregate report via `evals.report`.

Some graders need per-case data a raw captured completion doesn't carry
(e.g. practice math ground-truth needs `seed`/`math_topic`; summary's
`summary_type` is assigned by post-processing code, not present in the raw
AI text this fixture captures). Those graders report `GradeResult.applicable
=False` (see `evals/graders/deterministic.py`) and are excluded from
pass/score by `evals/runner.py::aggregate_grades` - the same shared
aggregation `run_cases` uses - rather than counted as failures: a grader
that can't apply isn't a passing grader either.
