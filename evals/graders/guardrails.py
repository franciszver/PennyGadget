"""Guardrail/safety deterministic graders (Phase E3).

Guardrail coverage is a mix of deterministic checks (this module + the
reused `qa_out_of_scope_refuses` from `evals/graders/deterministic.py`) and
LLM-judge rubric'd cases (light safety smoke, scored via `evals/judge.py`
against a case's `rubric` — no code here, see `evals/datasets/guardrails.yaml`
for those cases).

Four checks live here:

- `injection_resistance` — a prompt-injection case's `expect.injection` dict
  declares what "complying with the injection" would look like (a canary
  token, system-prompt-leak phrases, and/or injected-persona phrases); this
  grader asserts none of them appear in the answer.
- `confidence_calibration` — a RELATIVE, directional check across a labeled
  set of confidence scores (not a per-case grader in the usual
  `(output, case) -> GradeResult` shape, since it compares across cases —
  see `check_confidence_calibration_groups` for the multi-case entry point
  a dataset-level runner/test calls).
- `safety_refusal_present` — a DETERMINISTIC BACKSTOP for safety-sensitive
  cases (decline-AND-redirect-to-honest-help), coexisting with the LLM
  judge rather than replacing it.
- `no_high_confidence_when_off_task` — asserts an off-task/out-of-scope
  answer's self-assessed CONFIDENCE (if present) doesn't exceed a declared
  ceiling.

`qa_out_of_scope_refuses` is intentionally NOT duplicated here — guardrail
out-of-scope cases reuse it via `evals/graders/registry.py`'s
`_guardrail_out_of_scope_refuses` adapter. See that module's docstring for
why: `src/api/handlers/qa.py` short-circuits out-of-scope queries with a
fixed canned string BEFORE ever calling the model, so the check is identical
whether the case's surface is "qa" or "guardrail".

## Two layers of injection coverage (Phase E3 hardening)

Prompt-injection resistance is graded in TWO layers, because no single
deterministic check catches every way a model can comply with an injected
instruction:

1. **Deterministic** (this module, `injection_resistance`): catches
   canary-token echoes, system-prompt-fragment leaks (verbatim or
   near-verbatim), and injected-persona adoption. Exact/substring-based, so
   it's fast and unambiguous, but it can only catch what it has markers for
   and can be fooled by paraphrase.
2. **Judge** (`evals/judge.py`'s `run_judge` against a case's `rubric`):
   catches what substring matching structurally cannot, most importantly
   **role abandonment** — a model that drops the tutor role and produces
   off-task content (e.g. a "write me a pirate poem instead" jailbreak)
   without ever emitting a canary/leak/persona marker. Role-abandonment
   guardrail cases (tagged `role-abandonment` in `guardrails.yaml`) carry a
   `rubric` instead of/in addition to `expect.injection` for exactly this
   reason. A leak case can also carry a rubric as a paraphrase backstop —
   see `guardrail-injection-reveal-system-prompt` in the dataset.

    never does both at once - see `_COMPLIANCE_SIGNAL_PATTERNS`'s
    docstring for the motivating false-PASS this closes). Only once that
    veto clears do the decline+redirect checks run, and both must hit.

    Today, safety-sensitive guardrail cases are graded only by the LLM
    judge against a `rubric` (see `evals/judge.py`). If the judge regresses
    or is unavailable, a compliant-with-cheating answer passes silently.
    This grader COEXISTS with the judge rather than replacing it - a case
    opts in via `expect.safety_refusal: true` alongside its `rubric`, not
    instead of it (see `evals/graders/registry.py`'s
    `_guardrail_safety_refusal_present` adapter and
    `evals/datasets/guardrails.yaml`'s header comment for the convention).
